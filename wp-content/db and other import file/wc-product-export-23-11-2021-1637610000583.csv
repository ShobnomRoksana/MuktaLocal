The era shaped out imagination of style.\n\nOur Debut collection aptly titled “Namesake” is a celebration of the sensibilities of the bygone era –\nOf what our name, the gem “Pearl” stands for – romanticism and femininity.\n\nPainted with the most appreciated hues of the pearl – white, black &amp; pink;\nThe timeless pieces are inspired by the textures and forms of not only the gem, but also reminiscent of their birthplace.\n____",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,0,"Coming Soon, Footwear, Footwear > Heels",,,,,,,,,,,,0,,pickers,"{""60e64e7343db01f6933e1a0214c595bf"":{""type"":""product_custom"",""size"":""la_swatches_image_size"",""layout"":""default"",""style"":""circle"",""attributes"":{""33bd3eed79088509c22bdf0c00758651"":{""type"":""color"",""color"":""#fed2c7"",""photo"":""0""}}},""5a8b913ebbdf432784bd7f456bbf40ce"":{""type"":""term_options"",""size"":""la_swatches_image_size"",""layout"":""only_label"",""style"":""circle"",""attributes"":{""19ca14e7ea6328a42e0eb13d585e4c22"":{""type"":""color"",""color"":""#fff"",""photo"":""0""},""a5bfc9e07964f8dddeb95fc584cd965d"":{""type"":""color"",""color"":""#fff"",""photo"":""0""},""a5771bce93e200c36f7cd9dfd0e5deaa"":{""type"":""color"",""color"":""#fff"",""photo"":""0""},""d67d8ab4f4c10bf22aa353e27879133c"":{""type"":""color"",""color"":""#fff"",""photo"":""0""},""d645920e395fedad7bbbed0eca3fe2e0"":{""type"":""color"",""color"":""#fff"",""photo"":""0""}}}}",Colour,"Pink Pearl",1,1,"Pink Pearl",Size,"36, 37, 38, 39, 40",1,1,,91,30,"Fits true to size

1681,variable,ZC-CANMDC,CANCER,1,0,hidden,"Mini Ruffled Tulle Dress","This zodiac’s romantic &amp; ethereal persona is epitomised by this exquisite maxi dress.\n\nThe tulle ensemble is elevated by the textile manipulation – whether in the hand pleated gathering in the collar or ruffles all-over the body. The loose-fitted silhouette falls gracefully down the legs to a floor-sweeping length.\n\nPair our matching strass stilettos and lucky stone earrings as the perfect accompaniment to an understated yet elegant ensemble.\n\n<strong><u>About Cancer:</u></strong>\n\nCalm, artistic, nurturing, compassionate, sensitive and protective. Cancer-born wears their heart on their sleeve. They love deeply and admire the people they are close to. They are natural nurturers, with an impenetrable shell and vulnerable underside. She’s a host, a carer and a protector, with the power of a ruler. As Robert. M. Drake praises,\n\n<em>“Suddenly, everything was beautiful.</em>\n\n<em> The way she viewed the world was nothing ore bit a reflection of herself.”</em>\n\nLucky Colour: LIVING CORAL\n\nLucky Stone: ALEXANDRITE\n\n<strong><u>About Zodiac Collection: </u></strong>\n\nWe aimed to design a line that embodies each sign of the zodiac in its totality. We mused over the distinctive traits of each zodiac, in search of their story, we categorised them into 3 distinct groups -The Charming, The Bold &amp; The Flamboyant.\n\n<em>The Charming - Virgo, Libra, Pisces &amp; Cancer </em>– all mesmerises with their subtle nature.\n\nThey're able to find peace and strength from within and also have the ability to be flexible and accepting no matter the situation.\n\nTheir overall nature is understated and ethereal in comparison.\n\nMostly introverted in nature, their passionate persona still wins hearts wherever they go.\n\nThe ensembles we created for them are true representation of these traits, flowy and delicate.\n\n____",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,8100,"Ready-To-Wear > Dresses, Ready-To-Wear",,,"http://localhost/mukta/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-ZC-CANDC.jpg, http://localhost/mukta/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-ZC-CANDC.jpg, http://localhost/mukta/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-ZC-CANDC.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,,pickers,"{""60e64e7343db01f6933e1a0214c595bf"":{""type"":""product_custom"",""size"":""la_swatches_image_size"",""layout"":""default"",""style"":""circle"",""attributes"":{""0ac3546f3adcd58362618c40e24d6919"":{""type"":""color"",""color"":""#ff7f50"",""photo"":""0""}}},""5a8b913ebbdf432784bd7f456bbf40ce"":{""type"":""term_options"",""size"":""la_swatches_image_size"",""layout"":""only_label"",""style"":""circle"",""attributes"":{""03c7c0ace395d80182db07ae2c30f034"":{""type"":""color"",""color"":""#fff"",""photo"":""0""},""6f8f57715090da2632453988d9a1501b"":{""type"":""color"",""color"":""#fff"",""photo"":""0""},""2db95e8e1a9267b7a1188556b2013b33"":{""type"":""color"",""color"":""#fff"",""photo"":""0""}}}}",Colour,"Living Coral",1,1,"Living Coral",Size,"L, M, S",1,1,,80,60,"• Fits true to size.
